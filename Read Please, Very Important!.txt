Hi Sir,

I just had to say that this isn't the Second class paraticle as i haven't been able to start it.

I've been running behind in class in a few classes because of assessmests as well as with me being sick for basically the first 3 weeks of the trimester And several other things related to Uni. I'll right you an email about it in more detail tomorrow morning. the TLDR however is that week 5 - 8 whilst I've been fully engaged in class work I've had several obstructions preventing me from fully completing class work with some of weeks 5 and 6 done and class and the other part's i haven't been able to do till today week 7 not done & week 8 is finished up till the point when the powersurge happened but i just wrote it done in the software brackects till i could coopy it over to Visual studio to stop the program from getting more jumbble and confusing.

I beleive that I remeber you saying in previous weeks that a class practical not being submitted just meant lost overall marks and not automatic failer which I do hope is the case and I'm not just remembering wrong but i was sure if you meant that i file didn't have to be subbmitted at all or you mean it didn't have to be done so that's why I've submitted this.

I'll send a better planned out and more through email as soon as i can to follow up on this Note.
